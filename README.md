# March Madness Predictive Analytics

## Overview

This repository analyzes regular season trends and commonalities between past March Madness winners in pursuit of predicting various aspects of the tournament. Specifically, I am looking to predict the overall outcome of the tournament and'upsets' within the tournament. 'Upsets' can be defined as a higher ranked seed winning a game against a lower ranked seed.
